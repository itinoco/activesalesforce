== Welcome to Active Salesforce

  ActiveSalesforce is an extension to the Rails Framework that allows for the dynamic creation and management of 
  ActiveRecord objects through the use of Salesforce meta-data and uses a Salesforce.com organization as the backing store.


== Getting started

1. gem install activesalesforce
2. if you have not already done so generate your initial rails app using "rails <myappname goes here>" 
3. edit config/environment.rb and add "require_gem 'activesalesforce'" to the end of the "Rails::Initializer.run do |config|" block, e.g.

		Rails::Initializer.run do |config|
		  ...
		  
		  require_gem 'activesalesforce'
		end

4. edit database.yml

		adapter: salesforce
  		url: <salesforce api server url goes here>
  		username: <salesforce user name goes here>
  		password: <salesforce password goes here>
  		
5. proceed using standard Rails development techniques!  	

NOTE: To use a custom object append the word Custom to the name of the object instead of __c, e.g. FlipflapOnTheDuckmill would be FlipflapOnTheDuckmillCustom
